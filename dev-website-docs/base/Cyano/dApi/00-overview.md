DAPI is decentralized API for dApps on Ontology blockchain. dAPI is an implementation from [OEP-6](https://github.com/backslash47/OEPs/blob/oep-dapp-api/OEP-6/OEP-6.mediawiki) and [CEP1](https://github.com/ontio-cyano/CEPs/blob/master/CEP1.mediawiki)) communication protocol.

It is necessary to have installed suitable **dAPI provider** . Reference implementation is [Cyano Wallet of Chrome](https://github.com/ontio/cyano-wallet) and [cyano-android](https://github.com/ontio-cyano/cyano-android).

The library is written in TypeScript, so all the methods and objects are typed. It is therefore usable in TypeScript projects as well as vanilla JavaScript projects.
